                            <p>I'm an aspiring web developer who loves to learn. I enjoy coding with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and Jquery. I'm also familiar with some backend such as node, mySQL and express. 
                             I studied English at the University of Central Missouri for four years, and have recently gone through the full-stack coding bootcamp through the University of Kansas Edwards Campus.
                             I love being creative, and have long considered myself an artist visually and musically. This is part what drew me to Web Development. I can create, I can solve problems with many varied answers and express myself in many ways.</p>
                            <p>I consider myself a pop culture nerd but I also love sports. When Star Wars night happens at the K, you can usually find me there! I also love gaming and technology, staying up to date with what's new is a must for me. </p>
